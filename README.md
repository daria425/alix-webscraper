# Local Council Scraper

A web scraping web application made for my internship at <a href="https://www.projectalix.com/">Alix</a> to facilitate and automate research on services, organizations and charities available in different councils across the UK.

The application automatically extracts information such as organization name, website, contact detail and address from pages of the council directory within each category creates a downloadable CSV file using Selenium and pandas.

### Directories currently available (more to be added):

- <a href="https://cindex.camden.gov.uk/kb5/camden/cd/home.page">Camden Council</a>
- <a href="https://findyour.islington.gov.uk/kb5/islington/directory/home.page">Islington Council</a>
